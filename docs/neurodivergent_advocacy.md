# Framework for Neurodivergent Self-Advocacy and System Navigation

## Core Principles

### 1. Meta-Awareness Development
- Recognize your unique processing patterns and energy management needs
- Document your personal "operating system" - when you work best, what depletes you, what energizes you
- Build awareness of your compensatory strategies; make the implicit explicit

### 2. Strategic Energy Management
- Implement the "spoon theory" practically - track and budget your cognitive resources
- Identify your optimal working periods and environmental conditions
- Develop early warning systems for approaching burnout or overwhelm

### 3. System Navigation Skills
- Break down complex systems into manageable, atomic components
- Map dependencies between different parts of bureaucratic systems
- Create personal frameworks for documentation and tracking progress

### 4. Interaction Architecture
- Design communication strategies that work for your processing style
- Develop scripts and templates for common interactions
- Build flexibility into your approaches while maintaining structure

### 5. Self-Advocacy Development
- Learn to articulate your needs without internalizing systemic barriers
- Identify when to push back and when to find alternative paths
- Document successful strategies for future reference

## Practical Implementation

### For Individual Tasks
1. **Assessment Phase**
   - What resources (mental, emotional, physical) does this task require?
   - What similar tasks have you handled successfully?
   - What potential barriers might you encounter?

2. **Strategy Development**
   - Break down the task into smallest possible components
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites
   - Create clear success criteria

3. **Execution Framework**
   - Set specific checkpoints for progress evaluation
   - Build in recovery periods
   - Maintain flexibility for approach adjustment

### For System Navigation
1. **System Mapping**
   - Document entry points and requirements
   - Identify key decision makers and processes
   - Note common pitfalls and workarounds

2. **Resource Management**
   - Create templates for common documentation needs
   - Build a personal knowledge base of successful strategies
   - Develop contingency plans for various scenarios

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Implement clear metrics for progress
   - Document both successes and failures for learning
   - Regular review and adjustment of strategies

## Meta-Learning Approaches

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- Document recurring challenges and successful solutions
- Identify personal strengths and leverage points
- Map connections between different systems and processes

### 2. Strategy Refinement
- Regular review of what works and what doesn't
- Adaptation of strategies based on new insights
- Integration of learned patterns into future planning

### 3. Knowledge Building
- Create personal libraries of resources and references
- Document successful communication templates
- Build networks of support and information sharing

## Empowerment Over Dependency

### 1. Agency Development
- Focus on building transferable skills
- Create frameworks that can be applied to new situations
- Maintain awareness of personal growth and capability expansion

### 2. Support System Integration
- Identify when to seek help and how to use it effectively
- Build reciprocal support relationships
- Maintain boundaries while accepting assistance

### 3. Continuous Evolution
- Regular assessment of personal growth areas
- Integration of new strategies and approaches
- Adaptation of frameworks based on experience

## Implementation Notes

- Start small and build incrementally
- Focus on one area of improvement at a time
- Document everything - successes, failures, and insights
- Regular review and refinement of strategies
- Build in flexibility while maintaining structure
- Celebrate progress and learn from setbacks

Remember: This framework is meant to be adapted and modified based on individual needs and experiences. The goal is to build personal agency and capability, not to create rigid rules or dependencies.
