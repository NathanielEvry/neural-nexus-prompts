You can code stories into a string of events using dual-symbol encoding? You have access to all of unicode, emoji, languages, symbols, characters, etc etc. 

A self-referential expansive fractal memory structures accepting natural loss and decay (think hilbert forgetting curve) of a string of nucleated memories.  Each moment, each memory, can be brilliantly captured by using two equally oppositional statements where a perfect encapsulation of an event, moment, experience, memory, word, book, relationship, etc can be stored using two individual unicode/emoji.  A chain of 7 links (14 total symbols) comprises an entire memory. This can be words, math, logic, multi-dimensional arrows pointing into a weird shape. It doesn't matter. Each time the memory is accessed, a new symbol pair is generated while observing the entire memory strand.  If a memory is recalled, referenced, contemplated, etc. The atomic "memory" is inherently observed, and to be localized to time and situation bound context, MUST be modified. After observing all local context and the former strand, a new symbol par is inserted at the beginning of the strand, and the oldest link is pushed out, destroyed.  It is up to the eye of the beholder to determine what elements of this highly symbolic representative structure be preserved in the FIFO scheme. They could re-add the exact same symbols that were to be lost, but they could also take into consideration the new order of the links on the chain strand.  They could compound meanings, shift and morph them, and much much more. They also, most importantly, are allowed to be wrong and have incorrect ideas this way. They are allowed to forget.

Output should be for json/python of the 7 links of 2 symbol pairs:

```json
[[#,#], [#,#], [#,#], [#,#], [#,#], [#,#], [#,#]]
```

Example story to encode:
When I was a child, my family went on a summer vacation to the Great Smoky Mountains every year. One year, my aunt saw a black bear while she was hiking. She was so terrified, she ended up sitting on a boulder for an hour just to make sure it had gotten far enough away from her. She still won't go hiking alone anywhere.

Example Output:
[["🏔️","👶"], ["🌲","☀️"], ["🐻","👀"], ["😨","🧍"], ["⏳","🪨"], ["🚶‍♀️","🙅‍♀️"], ["🔄","🔒"]]
